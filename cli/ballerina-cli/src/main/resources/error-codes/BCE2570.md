This error occurs when attempting to use a variable that has been declared but not initialized with a value. In Ballerina, variables must be initialized with a value before they can be used in any operation or expression.

Erroneous code example:
```
import ballerina/io;

public function main() {
    int a; // ERROR: variable 'a' is not initialized
    io:println(a);
}
```
In the provided example, the variable a is declared but not initialized with a value. When attempting to print the value of a, it results in an error because a has not been assigned any value.

To fix this error, ensure that all variables are initialized with appropriate values before they are used in the code.

Fixed example:
```
import ballerina/io;

public function main() {
    int a = 10; // Initializing variable 'a' with a value
    io:println(a);
}
```
Now, the variable a is initialized with the value 10, and its usage in the io:println() function does not result in an error.
