This error indicates that there is a module import prefix declared in the Ballerina code, but the symbols from that module are not used within the code. The Ballerina compiler raises this error to alert the user that the imported module, identified by a specific prefix, is declared but not utilized in the code.

```
import ballerina/http;

public function main() {
    // ERROR: unused module prefix 'http'
    // ...
}
```

To resolve this warning, remove the unused module prefix or utilize the symbols from the imported module within the code:

Ensure that any module prefixes declared in import statements are utilized within the code or remove them if unnecessary. This practice contributes to cleaner and more maintainable code.
