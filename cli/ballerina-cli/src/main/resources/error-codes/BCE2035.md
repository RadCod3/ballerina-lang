This error occurs when there exists a field within a class definition that is never initialized. In Ballerina, all fields of an object must be initialized either directly upon declaration or within the class constructor.

Erroneous code example:
```
class Engineer {
    string name; // ERROR: uninitialized field 'name'

    function getName() returns string {
        return self.name;
    }
}
```
In the provided example, the field name is declared within the Engineer class but is not initialized anywhere in the class. This violates the requirement that all fields must be initialized.

To fix this error, ensure that all fields within the class are initialized either directly upon declaration or within the class constructor.

Fixed example:
```
class Engineer {
    string name = ""; // Initializing 'name' field

    function getName() returns string {
        return self.name;
    }
}
```

Now, the name field is initialized to an empty string upon declaration, resolving the uninitialized field error. Alternatively, you can initialize it within the constructor method if initialization requires more complex logic.

Alternative Fix:
```
class Engineer {
    string name;

    // Constructor to initialize the 'name' field
    function init(string name) {
        self.name = name;
    }
}
```
