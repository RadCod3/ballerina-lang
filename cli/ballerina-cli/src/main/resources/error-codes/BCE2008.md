This error indicates that a symbol, such as a variable or function, has been declared multiple times within the same scope, which is not permitted in Ballerina.

Erroneous code example:
```
int a = 10;
int a = 20; // ERROR: redeclared symbol 'a'
```

In the provided example, the variable 'a' is declared twice, which causes a conflict because variable names must be unique within the same scope.

Fixed example:
```
int a = 10;
```
To resolve this error, ensure that each symbol (variable, function, etc.) is declared only once within the same scope. If you need to reuse the same symbol name, consider using a different scope or renaming the symbols to avoid conflicts.
