This error signifies that the specified module, whether local or from the Ballerina Central repository, cannot be located during the compilation process. The module name might be misspelled, not present in the Ballerina distribution, or not added as a dependency in the project.

Erroneous code example:
```
import someInvalidModule; // ERROR: cannot resolve module 'someInvalidModule'
```

Fixed example:
```
import someValidModule;
```

Verify the existence of the module and its correct name, and import it accordingly. If the module is intended to be part of your project, confirm that it is included or referenced correctly in your project structure. If the module is expected to be available on Ballerina Central, ensure it exists and is spelled correctly.
