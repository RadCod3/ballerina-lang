This error occurs when the compiler or interpreter encounters a reference to a variable that has not been previously declared or defined within the scope where it is being used.

Erroneous code example:
```
int result = a + 5; // ERROR: undefined symbol 'a'
```

In the provided example, the variable 'a' is referenced in an expression, but it has not been declared or defined anywhere in the code.

Fixed example:
```
int a = 10;
int result = a + 5;
```

To resolve this error, ensure that all variables are declared or defined before they are used in the code. If you intend to use a variable, make sure it is declared in the appropriate scope and that its name is spelled correctly. If the variable is intended to be used from another scope, consider importing the module or accessing it through the appropriate scope qualifier.
