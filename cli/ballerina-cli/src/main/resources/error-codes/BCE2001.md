This error indicates that there is a cyclic dependency between two Ballerina modules during the compilation process. A cyclic dependency occurs when Module A depends on Module B, and Module B, directly or indirectly, depends on Module A, creating a circular chain of dependencies.

```
// Module A
import moduleB;

// Module B
import moduleA;
```

To resolve this issue, carefully analyze the module dependencies and reorganize them to eliminate the circular dependency. Ensure that the modules form a directed acyclic graph (DAG) in terms of imports, meaning there are no cycles in the module dependencies.

Review and adjust your module imports to break the circular dependency, allowing for a clean and acyclic module structure.
