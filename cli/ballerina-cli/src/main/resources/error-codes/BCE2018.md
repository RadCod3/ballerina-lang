This error occurs when there is a mismatch between the expected type of error detail and the actual type provided. In Ballerina, error detail is a map containing arbitrary additional information about the context of an error. When defining an error type with specific error details, the type of the error detail should be a record.

Erroneous code example:
```
error<int> httpError = error("Whoops", httpCode = 27);
```

In the provided example, the error httpError is defined with an error detail of type int. However, error detail should be a map type, not a primitive type like int. This results in the error: "invalid error detail type 'int', expected a subtype of 'map<ballerina/lang.value:0.0.0:Cloneable>'".

Fixed example:
```
// The `HttpDetail` type is a record type that defines the`httpCode` field  of type `int`.
type HttpDetail record {
    int httpCode;
};

// When included in the declaration of the `error<HttpDetail>` error type, it uses the
// `HttpDetail` record type as the error detail record.
error<HttpDetail> httpError = error("Whoops", httpCode = 27);
```

This definition conforms to the expected error detail type, which is a subtype of map<ballerina/lang.value:0.0.0:Cloneable>.
