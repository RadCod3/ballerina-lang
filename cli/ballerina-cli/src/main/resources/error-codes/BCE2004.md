This error suggests that a Ballerina module is attempting to import a module that has already been imported or declared in the current module. Each import declaration in a Ballerina module should be unique, and redeclaration of the same import module is not allowed.

Erroneous code example:

```
import ballerina/io;
import ballerina/io; // ERROR: redeclared import module 'ballerina/io'
```
Fixed example:

```
import ballerina/io;
```
Please ensure that each import declaration is unique within the module to resolve this error.
