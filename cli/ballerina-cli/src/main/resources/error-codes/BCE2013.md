This error occurs when attempting to call a method on an object that is not defined in the class of that object. In object-oriented programming languages like Ballerina, methods are typically defined within classes, and objects of those classes can only call methods that are part of their class definition.

Erroneous code example:
```
class MyClass {
    private int n = 0;
}

public function main() {
    MyClass obj = new MyClass();
    obj.inc(); // ERROR: undefined method 'inc' in object 'MyClass'
}
```
In the provided example, the method inc() is called on an object of class MyClass, but the inc() method is not defined within the MyClass class.

Fixed example:
```
class MyClass {
    private int n = 0;

    public function inc() {
        self.n += 1;
    }
}

public function main() {
    MyClass obj = new MyClass();
    obj.inc(); // Now 'inc()' method is defined in 'MyClass'
}
```

To resolve this error, ensure that the method you are trying to call is defined within the class of the object you are using. If you intend to use a method that belongs to another class, consider either defining that method within the class or accessing it through an appropriate object of that class.
