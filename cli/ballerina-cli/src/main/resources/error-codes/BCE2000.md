This error indicates that the Ballerina compiler is unable to find a module named 'io' during the compilation process. The 'io' module seems to be either misspelled, not imported, or not available in the project.

Erroneous code example:

```
io:println("Hello, World!"); // Error: undefined module 'io'
```
Fixed example:

```
import ballerina/io;
.
.
io:println("Hello, World!");
```
Please ensure that each import declaration is unique within the module to resolve this error.
