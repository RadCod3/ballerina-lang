This error indicates that the compiler encountered a reference to a function that has not been defined or declared within the scope where it is being called.

Erroneous code example:
```
public function main() {
    int result = calculateSum(a, b); // ERROR: undefined function 'calculateSum'
}
```

In the provided example, the function calculateSum is called, but it has not been defined or declared anywhere in the code.

Fixed example:
```
public function calculateSum(int x, int y) returns int {
    return x + y;
}

public function main() {
    int result = calculateSum(a, b);
}
```
To resolve this error, ensure that all functions called in the code are defined or declared somewhere within the code. If you intend to use a function, make sure it is defined in the appropriate scope and that its name is spelled correctly. If the function is intended to be used from another module or file, make sure it is imported or accessible in the current scope.
